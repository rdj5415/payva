## Security Overview

AuditPulse is designed with security as a core principle. The application handles sensitive financial data and implements multiple layers of security to protect this information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction.

### Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security controls are implemented at different layers.
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their functions.
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default and require explicit action to disable.
4. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities.
5. **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities and security events.

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

AuditPulse implements a robust authentication system:

- **JWT-based authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password policies**: Enforcement of strong passwords (minimum length, complexity requirements).
- **Password hashing**: Passwords are hashed using Argon2id with appropriate work factors.
- **Two-factor authentication**: Optional 2FA using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for additional security.
- **Account lockout**: Temporary account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
- **Session management**: Automatic session termination after inactivity, ability to view and terminate active sessions.

### Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented:

- **User roles**: Standard users, administrators, and system administrators with distinct permissions.
- **Resource-based permissions**: Access controls for specific resources (accounts, transactions, reports).
- **Tenant isolation**: Multi-tenant architecture with strict data isolation between tenants.

Implementation:

```python
# Example of permission check in endpoint
@router.get("/admin/users")
def list_users(
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user),
    permissions: PermissionChecker = Depends(get_permissions),
):
    permissions.check_permission("admin:read_users")
    # ... endpoint implementation
```

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- **Data in transit**: All communications are encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Data at rest**: Sensitive fields in the database are encrypted using AES-256.
- **Database encryption**: Full database encryption is recommended for production deployments.

### Sensitive Data Handling

- **PII minimization**: Only necessary personal information is collected and stored.
- **Sensitive data masking**: Account numbers and other sensitive information are masked in logs and UI.
- **Secure deletion**: Data is securely deleted when no longer needed.

### Financial Data Protection

- **Plaid integration security**: Access tokens for financial institutions are encrypted before storage.
- **Transaction data protection**: Transaction details are encrypted at rest.
- **Export controls**: Strict controls on data export functionality.

## API Security

### API Authentication

- **Token-based authentication**: All API requests require valid authentication tokens.
- **Token rotation**: Access tokens expire after a short period (default: 30 minutes).
- **Refresh token security**: Refresh tokens use secure cookies with HttpOnly and SameSite flags.

### Request/Response Security

- **Input validation**: All API inputs are validated against strict schemas.
- **Output sanitization**: Responses are filtered to prevent sensitive data leakage.
- **Error handling**: Generic error messages to users, detailed logs for administrators.

### Rate Limiting

- **Rate limiting by IP**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks.
- **Rate limiting by user**: Prevents API abuse by authenticated users.
- **Graduated response**: Increasing delays for repeated violations.

Implementation:

```python
# Apply rate limiting to authentication endpoints
@app.post("/api/v1/auth/login")
@limiter.limit("5/minute")
async def login(credentials: LoginCredentials):
    # ... login implementation
```

## Infrastructure Security

### Container Security

- **Minimal base images**: Use of slim/minimal base images to reduce attack surface.
- **Non-root users**: All services run as non-root users.
- **Read-only file systems**: Containers run with read-only file systems where possible.
- **Resource limits**: Strict CPU and memory limits for all containers.

### Network Security

- **Network segmentation**: Microservices communicate only over necessary internal networks.
- **Reverse proxy**: All external traffic is routed through a secure reverse proxy (Nginx).
- **Firewall rules**: Strict firewall rules limiting inbound and outbound connections.
- **TLS termination**: All TLS is terminated at the reverse proxy with modern cipher suites.

### Secrets Management

- **Environment variables**: Secrets are passed to services via environment variables.
- **No hard-coded secrets**: No secrets in source code or container images.
- **Secrets rotation**: Regular rotation of all credentials and secrets.

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Monitoring

- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive audit logs for security-relevant events.
- **Login monitoring**: Alerts for suspicious login patterns (unusual locations, times).
- **Privilege escalation monitoring**: Alerts for unexpected privilege changes.
- **API abuse detection**: Monitoring for unusual API usage patterns.

### Security Alerts

- **Real-time alerts**: Critical security events trigger immediate notifications.
- **Alert escalation**: Graduated alert system based on severity.
- **False positive reduction**: Smart filtering to reduce alert fatigue.

### Security Metrics

Key security metrics tracked:

- Failed login attempts
- Authentication token revocations
- Role/permission changes
- Admin actions
- API rate limit breaches
- Security patch status

## Compliance Considerations

Depending on deployment requirements, AuditPulse may need to comply with:

### Financial Regulations

- **PCI DSS**: If processing payment card information.
- **SOX**: For publicly traded companies.
- **GLBA**: For financial institutions in the US.

### Data Protection Regulations

- **GDPR**: For handling EU resident data.
- **CCPA/CPRA**: For handling California resident data.
- **Industry-specific regulations**: Healthcare (HIPAA), etc.

## Security Checklist

Use this checklist for new deployments:

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Generate strong, unique passwords for all services
- [ ] Set up 2FA for administrator accounts
- [ ] Configure TLS with appropriate certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Perform vulnerability scan on infrastructure
- [ ] Review and configure logging settings
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerts

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Conduct security review of deployed system
- [ ] Verify all communications are encrypted
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization controls
- [ ] Verify rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Test monitoring and alert system
- [ ] Document security configuration

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security patch application
- [ ] Credential rotation
- [ ] Log review
- [ ] Penetration testing (recommended annually)
- [ ] Security configuration review

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Types

- **Data breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Account compromise**: Unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Service disruption**: Security-related service unavailability.
- **Insider threat**: Misuse of authorized access.

### Incident Response Process

1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm the security incident.
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident.
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation.
5. **Post-incident analysis**: Analyze the incident and improve security measures.
